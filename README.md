## Local Development

### Setup

The following tools are recommended for local work:

- `git`: `>=2`
- Build: TeX Live with `latexmk` (LuaLaTeX) **or** Docker (`>=18.09`) for a containerized build
- Tests: Node.js `>=16` to install and run Prettier locally
- `make` (standard on macOS/Linux)

First clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ezpzbz/automated-cv.git
```

To work from your fork:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/automated-cv.git
```

Install local dev tools (Prettier):

```shell
npm install
```

### Test & Build Locally

- format (write): `npm run format`
- format (check): `npm run format:check`
- test: `make test` (runs Prettier; set `RUN_SUPER_LINTER=1` to run super-linter via Docker)
- build: `make build` (uses local `latexmk` when available, otherwise Docker)
- build a variant: `make build RESUME_TEX=src/resume_industry.tex` (outputs `resume_industry.pdf`)
- run test & build: `make all`
